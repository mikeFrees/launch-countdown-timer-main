### What I learned

how to use bezier curbes and the clip path. creation of animations. make partial borders on a div. found out that you can not combine border image with border radius.

how to use setInterval and setTimeout in js and how to format a string with String().padStart();

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
