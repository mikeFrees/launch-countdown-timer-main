## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- javascript
- scss with 7 - 1 file structure
- CSS animations

### What I learned

- How to use a b√©zier curve in animation timing
- The clip path property 
- The creation of animations in CSS
- How to make partial borders on a div
- I found out that you can not combine border image with border radius
- How to use setInterval and setTimeout in Javascript
- How to format a string with String().padStart();

### Continued development

I want to continue to develop my CSS and try to discover what i can do with the animation properties. During this project i discovered that i still have a lot to learn about Javascript and i will try to find more projects with where i need to use this.

### Useful resources

- [Boilerplate css file](https://blog.logrocket.com/what-should-modern-css-boilerplate-look-like) - This helped me build the starting points of my _base.scss file.
- [Cubic bezier generator](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) - A great website to make custom bezier curbes and preview the animation speed it creates.
- [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - A website to create complex custom clip paths.
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) - A online development environment i used to work on my project when i was away from home. And which i used as sandbox to create my animation.
